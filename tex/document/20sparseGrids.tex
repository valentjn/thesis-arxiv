\initial[lhang=0.06]{0.1em}{S}{parse grids are a versatile tool}
in computational mathematics and scientific computing.
As already mentioned in \cref{chap:10introduction},
their motivation is to ease the curse of dimensionality,
which states that the number of full grid points
grows exponentially in the dimensionality $d$ of the underlying domain.
Their general formulation and the possibility to employ sparse grids in a
regular, dimensionally adaptive, or spatially adaptive fashion
opens a broad field of theoretical and practical applications
to sparse grids.

Sparse grids have been known for at least half a century,
albeit not under this name.
A paper by Smolyak \cite{Smolyak63Quadrature} is usually regarded
as the first modern treatment of sparse grids in the form
of the combination technique \cite{Garcke13Sparse}.
Additionally, there are close connections to
hyperbolic crosses \cite{Temljakov82Approximation}
and to Boolean interpolation operators
\multicite{Delvos82Dvariate,Delvos89Boolean}.
The term \term{sparse grids} was coined by Zenger in 1991
\cite{Zenger91Sparse}.
Some important subsequent work for hierarchical bases was done by
Bungartz and Griebel
\multicite{%
  Bungartz92Duenne,%
  Griebel92Combination,%
  Bungartz98Finite,%
  Bungartz04Sparse%
}.
Since then, sparse grids have been applied to various fields,
for instance,
data mining
\multicite{Garcke01Data,Pandey08Regression,Pflueger10Spatially},
interpolation
\cite{Sickel11Spline},
quadrature
\cite{Gerstner98Numerical},
density estimation
\multicite{Griebel10Finite,Peherstorfer14Density},
PDEs
\multicite{Balder94Adaptive,Bungartz98Finite,Nobile16Adaptive}, and
optimization
\multicite{Ferenczi05Globale,Donahue09Robust,Valentin16Hierarchical}.
Various software toolboxes for sparse grids have been developed
\multicite{Klimke05Algorithm,Pflueger10Spatially,Stoyanov18User}.
For a general introduction to sparse grids,
see the tutorial by Garcke \cite{Garcke13Sparse} or
the more extensive survey by Bungartz and Griebel
\cite{Bungartz04Sparse}.

This chapter provides a consistent notational framework
for the definition of sparse grids with general basis functions.
The reason not to employ specific bases such as the common hat functions
or B-splines of higher degrees is two-fold:
First, we will define various new ``flavors'' of B-splines,
which is easier if the choice of basis is left open.
Second, most of the statements and theorems that we will make in this
thesis will hold for general basis functions
(in some cases with additional assumptions)
and not just for B-splines.

Besides the derivation of sparse grids with
coarser boundary points in \cref{sec:241coarseBoundary},
this section is mostly
a repetition of the definition of sparse grids with general basis functions.
Our notation and presentation will roughly follow
\cite{Pflueger10Spatially} and \cite{Garcke13Sparse}.
A more detailed introduction to sparse grids can be found in
\cite{Bungartz04Sparse}.
Original contributions of the thesis in this chapter
are the formalization of the hierarchical splitting for
arbitrary basis functions in \cref{sec:21nodalSpaces,sec:22hierSubspaces} and
the definition of sparse grids with coarse boundary in
\cref{sec:241coarseBoundary}.
